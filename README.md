# Interesting Apache Project for Data Scientists

[Spark - Lightning-fast unified analytics engine](https://spark.apache.org/)

[Kafka - Distributed streaming platform](https://kafka.apache.org/)
Apache Kafka® is a distributed streaming platform. What exactly does that mean?
A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
Process streams of records as they occur.
Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data


[Zeppelin - Web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and collaborative documents](http://zeppelin.apache.org/)
Web-based notebook that enables data-driven, 
interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more.

[Hadoop - Framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers](https://hadoop.apache.org/)
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

[Flink - Stateful Computations over Data Streams](https://flink.apache.org/)
Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.

[Cassandra - Manage massive amounts of data, fast, without losing sleep](http://cassandra.apache.org/)
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.


[Storm - Distributed realtime computation system](http://storm.apache.org/)
Apache Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime computation system. Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is a lot of fun to use!

Storm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Storm is fast: a benchmark clocked it at over a million tuples processed per second per node. It is scalable, fault-tolerant, guarantees your data will be processed, and is easy to set up and operate.

Storm integrates with the queueing and database technologies you already use. A Storm topology consumes streams of data and processes those streams in arbitrarily complex ways, repartitioning the streams between each stage of the computation however needed. Read more in the tutorial.

[Tez](https://tez.apache.org/)
The Apache TEZ® project is aimed at building an application framework which allows for a complex directed-acyclic-graph of tasks for processing data. It is currently built atop Apache Hadoop YARN.
