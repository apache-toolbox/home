[Kafka - Distributed streaming platform](https://kafka.apache.org/)

Apache KafkaÂ® is a distributed streaming platform. What exactly does that mean?
A streaming platform has three key capabilities:

Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
Process streams of records as they occur.
Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data


[Zeppelin - Web-based notebook that enables data-driven, interactive data analytics and collaborative documents](http://zeppelin.apache.org/)

Web-based notebook that enables data-driven, 
interactive data analytics and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more.

[Hadoop - Framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers](https://hadoop.apache.org/)

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

[Flink   Stateful Computations over Data Streams](https://flink.apache.org/)

Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.
